# Full Stack Demo
This Folder will contain two project folders, one for the front end Vue app, and one for the back end Node API. They are the folders that should be opened in VSCode when working on either of them, and they are where the node_modules should be kept. This parent folder is just to hold the repo that tracks them both and this readme file that tracks the steps taken.

Note that this readme file is written using markdown syntax, so you can view it in the proper form using VSCode's markdown previewer using CTRL + SHIFT + V, or any markdown viewer of your choice.

This project will have a front end interface that will allow the user to create, view and delete reminders by communicating with a back end API that stores the data nd handles requests to send, add or remove entries in the data.

We begin with a basic empty folder structure.
